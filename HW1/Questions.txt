Question 1:

Initial Probaility Vector  pi:

[P(c1) P(C2)] = [0.5 0.5]


Transisition Probability Matrix A:

[0.5 0.5]
[0.5 0.5]


Observation probability Matrix B:

[0.9 0.1]
[0.5 0.5]

Question 2:
Multiplying our A matrix with our PI vector gives us an estimate of our states in the next timestep.
The equations in 2.3-2.5 calculates the probability of seeing heads when flipping a coin. 

Question 3:
If we multiply our estimate of states with the observation matrix we get an estimate of what emissions we may see. 

Question 4:

Question 5:
N = number of states
T = length of observation sequence
Size of delta:  N*T
Size of delta_index = N*(T-1)


Question 6:
To restructure the equation so we no longer depend on something something break out stuff. 


Question 7:
Yes. 1000 samples takes 2040 iterations
	10000 takes 15114 iterations
convergation is defined as:
if the logshit starts to increase before maxiters has been attained. 
The values of the calculated A and B matrices should match the matrices that generated the sequence.


Question 8:
Somewhere in the same ballpark
yOU CANÂ´T ESTIMATE WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW!!!!!!?!!!! GURL
sOLVE IT BY kNOWING gTHE gHOAL

Question 9:
We get values which does not correspond to a value in the generation matrices.

Three hidden states and four observations is the best choice due to the generation matrices are those sizes...



Question 10:

Uniform: 3 iterations. Bad result. More or less the same values as the initialization matrices

diagonal: Dividing by zero -> result NaN

Close to solution: 1948 iterations. Closer than init-matrices but not perfect. Not much better than the init-matrices from question 7.
